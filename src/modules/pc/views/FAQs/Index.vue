          <p class="p1">What is UniArts' ultimate goal?</p>
          <div class="des">
            Our ultimate goal is to provide the sort of NFT infrastructure, community voting, DAO
            curation, and art grants that allow for the true democratization of art.

          <p class="p1">Why was UniArts developed with Substrate?</p>
          <div class="des">
            UniArts' major functions are achieved by NPoS voting and on-chain governance which is
            aided by Substrate's development. It also pairs nicely with other facilities which were
            developed with Substrate, such as Crust, which handles decentralized content storage, a
            must-have for NFT connoisseurs.

        <div class="item">
          <p class="p1">How can artists use UniArts?</p>
          <div class="des">
            Its simple, first upload your existing artworks and mint them into NFTs. Next, bind them
            with curators (validator) nodes. After these two steps, people will be able to vote for
            the NFTs. When your NFTs get enough votes, UARTS will be minted into your NFTs, adding
            additional value.

        <div class="item">
          <p class="p1">How will UniArts help creators?</p>
          <div class="des">
            Yes, that's our mission. We hate the artwork market being monopolized by few, we are so
            sorry to see talented artists being rejected by galleries and their works
            underestimated. In UniArts, artists donâ€™t have to sell their works, being loved by
            people and being voted in will receive reward as well as a chance to receive art grants
            and listed in offline curation.<br />

          <p class="p1">How is UniArts different from other NFT platforms?</p>
          <div class="des">
            UniArts' focus and goals vary from the majority of NFT platforms. We are all about
            voting, selecting, and incubating artists like hidden gems and letting more appreciators
            discover and trade their amazing artwork. Estabilished artists will also find great
            value in UniArts, though they are not the main focus, which is another unique aspect of
            our model.<br />

          <p class="p1">What is NPoS?</p>
          <div class="des">
            NPoS stands for Nominated Proof-of-Stake, which has been adopted from both Polkadot and
            Substrate. In the simplest of terms, it's people staking their tokens to vote for
            network nodes in order to receive block rewards. The selected nodes are responsible for
            ensuring the stability of the network, and receive rewards for doing so, along with the
            token holders that voted for them.

        <div class="item">
          <p class="p1">What is DAO curation and how does it relate to UniArts?</p>
          <div class="des">
            DAO curation is one way of understanding UniArts' NPOS. Curator running nodes for the
            network, invite artist to bind the NFTs they created with nodes in order to be voted,
            the artworks will be exhibited in the voting gallery, curator also need to alloctated
            block reward once selected as validator. Both exhibition and appreciation NFT can be
            rewarded, the whole process is decentralized.<br />

          <p class="p1">Will UniArts partner with other leaders in the ecosystem?</p>
          <div class="des">
            Yes. We already partner with Crust and Darwinia and are in the process of connecting
            with Artsy and Processing. These are market leaders in online galleries and visual art
            languages respectively.<br />

          <p class="p1">Does UniArts have the intention of diversifying in the future?</p>
          <div class="des">
            We actually already have. While artist incubation is and always be our primary focus, we
            will also be providing business solutions for IP to setup an NFT marketplace which
            support flat-money purchase. UniArts is also expanding into a multi ecosystem, like
            Polygon and and Difinty.

          <p class="p1">What disruptive innovation is UniArts bringing?</p>
          <div class="des">
            One of the innovations we are most proud of is the implementation of Nominated Proof of
            Stake (NPoS) voting to "crowd select" some of the most desirable artworks and mint block
            rewards into NFTs. This will have a positive effect on liquidity and quality incentives.
